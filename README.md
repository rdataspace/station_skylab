## Skylab Space Station
Skylab was the first U.S. space station and the only one operated exclusively by the U.S.

It operated in low Earth orbit from 1973 to 1979. It was occupied by three crew of three for a total of 172 days.

Skylab was designed for long durations to prove that humans could live and work in space for extended periods.

It was also used to expand the knowledge of solar astronomy beyond Earth-based observations.
